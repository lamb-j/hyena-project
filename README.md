# Modeling Social Network Dynamics in the Spotted Hyena (Crocuta crocuta)
Summer 2013, Knoxville, Tennessee, NIMBioS REU

In this study, we examined the Spotted Hyena Talek clan in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve using observational data collected during a 22-year study. We worked to model the hyena population as a social network, allowing us to show relationships, social rank, and reproductive fitness of subgroups of Hyenas. Our results may indicate that a model including social interactions between groups of Hyenas can be used to more accurately predict fitness, or Hyena survival.
